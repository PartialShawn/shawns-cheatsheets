# My *Managing Github Projects* Notes
Some basic notes on managing Github projects: organization, configuration and common question.


* [Folder configuration](https://github.com/kriasoft/Folder-Structure-Conventions)
* Commit the project via [command line](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/) ([don't add gitignore, readme or license](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/))
* [Use gitignore and default files](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3319626) to hide local security configurations (config.php) and error_log
* [Choose a license](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/), and [maybe not GPL 3](https://www.cnet.com/news/torvalds-no-gpl-3-for-linux/). [Maybe not GPL](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2009/2/12/are-you-sure-you-want-to-use-gpl/). Try [ChooseALicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/)

Create repo first, then git the files in? Or can you make a repo from git? Probably not.
