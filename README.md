# ManagingGithubProjects
Some basic notes on managing Github projects: organization, configuration and common question.


* [Folder configuration](https://github.com/kriasoft/Folder-Structure-Conventions)
* [Use gitignore and default files](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3319626) to hide local security configurations
* Choose a license, and [maybe not GPL 3](https://www.cnet.com/news/torvalds-no-gpl-3-for-linux/).

Create repo first, then git the files in? Or can you make a repo from git? Probably not.
